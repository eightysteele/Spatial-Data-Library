Terrestrial-10min-unbuffered-dissolved is an ESRI Shapefile as a 
single shape containing all of the area for which the there are
Worldclim data at 10-minute resolution. This file is used as a 
clipping layer against the rectangular grid cells, the result of
which is used in variable extraction for the remaining cells using 
starspan.

The source of Terrestrial-10min-unbuffered-dissolved.shp was the 
file tmean12.bil from the 10 minute Worldclim Mean Temperature data set 
(http://biogeo.ucdavis.edu/data/climate/worldclim/1_4/tiles/cur/tmean_10m_bil.zip).

The file was produced by several processing steps:

1. gdal_polygonize tmean12.bil to turn the raster source into a shape
derivative covering the area having data.

2. Use QGIS Dissolve on the Variable DN to produce an intermediary
shape file having one shape for every value of the DN column. This step
was slow, but it made for a rapid step 3.

3. Use QGIS Dissolve on all variables to produce the file shapefile
having one shape for all of the area having data. Attempts to produce
this dissolve directly from the results of step 1 repeatedly failed
after more than 24 hours of processing, hence the addition of step 2.
